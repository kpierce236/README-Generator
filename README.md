# README Generator

## Description

In this application I created a README generator using Node.js and inquirer. I also used npm to manage the dependencies such as inquirer (CLI) for user input. Using Node.js I created custom built functions that render markdown based on the user input repsones from the command line . This app is a useful Command Line application that takes in user input to then make a README.

### Take-Aways

- My motivation for this project was to increase my knowledge of Node.js  and npm.

- The problem my README Generator app solved is that it helps people create README files.

- I learned about npm modules like inquirer to handle user input from the command line, and Node.js.

## Usage

This appilcation creates a README in markdown from the command line by using user input.

- After you install all the dependienceis from the command line, your are then prompted with multiple questions about each section of the README. 
- You can choose the shape of logo (Circle, Triangle, Square).
- After you answer each section a README file is then generated.
